Tutorials on the ErgoSCF electronic structure package


* 1_sp  - a simple UHF/6-31G calculation example for HF molecule, prints out the AO overlap and Hamiltonian matrices, and the eigenvalues/eigenvectors

* 2_sp - same as 1_sp, but with a SLURM submit file

* 3_nacs - compute nonadiabatic couplings
